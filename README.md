# Limited Functionality Notice: Web Scraping Unavailable

Please note that due to financial constraints as a student developer, web scraping functionality is unavailable on this hosted website. While the website functions seamlessly when run locally, the current hosting environment prohibits real-time data fetching. Consequently, the HEADLINES, WEATHER, QUOTE, HOROSCOPE, and MOON CYCLE elements are presented as static content for demonstration purposes only. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this limitation, which is currently beyond my control. For the complete functionality of AstroTask, I recommend hosting the website locally by following the instructions provided in the next section. Thank you for your understanding.


# Running Locally 

To utilize the full functionality of the website on your own computer, please ensure that you have Python 3 installed. You can run the website locally by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
python3 app.py

This command will start the local server and allow you to access the website through your web browser at the designated address (typically http://127.0.0.1:5000/). By running the website locally, you will be able to enjoy all the functionalities provided by AstroTask.
